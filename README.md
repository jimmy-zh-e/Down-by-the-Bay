# Down by the Bay
Down by the bay  
Where the watermelons grow  
Back to my home  
I dare not go  
For if I do  
My mother will say  

"Did you ever see a goose  
Kissing a moose?"  
Down by the bay.  

Down by the bay 
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say

"Have you ever seen a goat 
Cruising on a boat?"
Down by the bay.

Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say

"Have you ever seen a mouse
building a house?"
down by the bay.

Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow 
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say

"Have you ever seen a frog 
dancing on a log?"
Down by the bay.

Down by the bay 
where the watermelons grow
Back to my home 
I dare not go 
For if I do
My mother will say

"Have you ever seen a bee 
sipping ice tea?"
Down by the bay.

Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow 
Back to my home 
I dare not go 
For if I do
My mother will say

"Have you ever seen a fox 
putting on sox?"
Down by the bay.

Down by the bay 
Down by the bay
